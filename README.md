# Typing-Speed-Test-Game-version-2--Using-Json-

## Overview 
This project is a copy of this project I've made over here:<br>
https://mohamed0tarek.github.io/Typing-Speed-Test-Game-version-2-/
<br>but the only difference is that In this project I used `json` to store the Data(paragraphs), and `fetch` to get a specific Data(pragraph) to work on.
